BASINS 4 and BASINS 3 can co-exist under the same /BASINS/
folder and still function properly.

If this computer has BASINS version 3.1 installed, then
install BASINS 4 under the current /BASINS/ folder. This 
will update some of the files used by BASINS 3.1.
If BASINS 4 is later removed and not reinstalled, then BASINS 3.1
will need to be re-installed and patched with the latest update.

If this computer has a beta version of BASINS 4, then the beta
should be uninstalled prior to installation of BASINS 4.

Note: If Microsoft's .NET framework is not on the computer,
then the install will direct you to install the .NET framework
from the web before installing BASINS.
