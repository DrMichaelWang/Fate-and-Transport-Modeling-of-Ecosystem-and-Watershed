   32    input data.  You now need to specify WATER    
   32            BODY type, AIR TEMPERATURE.

   33    You have not specified a Wind speed in the    
   33   Environmental Time Functions.  The Wind speed  
   33     has been defaulted to 0.3 meters/second.

   34 You have not specified an Air Temperature.  With 
   34  the release of WASP 4.2 wind driven reaeration  
   34     needs an ambient air temperture.  See the    
   34  UPDATE.DOC file on how to add a Air Temperature 
   34                  Time Function.

   35      The Water Temperature has fallen below      
   35    Zero, WASP is assuming Ice Cover, there is    
   35                  NO reaeration.

   36  You have specified an INVALID Air temperature.  
   36  Valid temperature Ranges are 0 - 100 Degrees C

   37 Group J Initial Conditions.  This has been defaul
   37 to 1.  Please review the WASP4 documentation to i
   37  this was a proper default for your simulation.

   38  WASP allows you to store the simulation results 
   38  in directory other then the default directory.  
   38 You need to specify the DRIVE and PATH where the 
   38  simulation results will be stored.  NOTE:  You  
   38        must end the path with a slash "\"        
   38               Example: C:\RESULTS\

   40 The WASP4 input data structure has changed.  The 
   40 first variable entered on line 4 of card group A 
   40   is number of segments (NOSEG).  KSIM has been  
   40   removed.  See the UPDATE.DOC file for a full

   41 Press RETURN for a list of input file name(s).
   41 Then use the cursor to point and choose (by
   41 hitting the RETURN key) the correct file name
   41 for model run execution.
